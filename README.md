# Clinical Resource Optimization through Predictive Analytics üè•üìä

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing predictive models to forecast the **Length of Stay (LOS)** for hospital patients. By accurately predicting LOS, hospitals can enhance their resource allocation, improve patient care, and streamline operational efficiency.

## Key Objectives
- **Predict Length of Stay (LOS)** for patients using clinical data.
- **Enhance Hospital Operations**: Enable better planning and allocation of critical resources by forecasting patient discharge times.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Identify key features that influence patient stay durations and outcomes.

## Data Exploration
- **Data Overview**: The dataset comprises patient records with various clinical and demographic attributes.
- **Initial Analysis**: Conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the distribution, trends, and relationships between key variables.

## Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, standardized data formats, and removed irrelevant or noisy data.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features to capture interactions between existing variables.
  - Applied scaling and normalization to ensure uniform data distribution.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Encoded categorical variables using appropriate techniques to make them suitable for machine learning models.

## Model Development
- **Algorithms Used**: Implemented various regression models, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **Gradient Boosting Machines**
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employed metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

## Results and Insights
- The models provided significant insights into which factors most strongly predict patient LOS, helping prioritize resource management.
- **Feature Importance Analysis** revealed that factors such as age, diagnosis type, and admission type were crucial predictors.

## Future Enhancements
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters for better predictive accuracy.
- **Integration**: Implement real-time prediction models for hospital systems to use during patient intake.
- **Additional Features**: Include external variables like hospital capacity and patient comorbidities to further refine predictions.

## Requirements
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed (`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`).
3. Run the `Clinical predictive analytics.ipynb` notebook to see data preparation, model training, and predictions.
